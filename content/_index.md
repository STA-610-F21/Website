### Course Overview
Statistical models are necessary for analyzing the type of multivariate (often large) datasets that are usually encountered in data science and statistical science, and hierarchical models often play a vital role in many of those applications. This is a graduate-level course that introduces students to the building blocks of hierarchical modeling and provides students with the tools needed to build, fit and interpret hierarchical models.

Hierarchical or multilevel models provide a principled way to model naturally grouped or clustered data, in a way that takes advantage of the relationship between observations in the same group, but also allows for borrowing of information across the groups. In this course, you will be introduced to these models, with particular emphasis on the theoretical and conceptual foundations, as well as implementation, model fitting, and interpretation of the results.

This course emphasizes the mathematical theory behind hierarchical models, as well as real data analyses, including interpretation of results. All students must have the theoretical background covered in the prerequisites (in particular, in the context of Bayesian statistics) to be able to keep up with and understand the materials.


### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to

- Understand the foundations and general structure of both classical and Bayesian hierarchical models.
- Specify and fit hierarchical models to various types of grouped or clustered data.
- Use the models covered in class to analyze real data sets.
- Assess the adequacy of hierarchical models to any given data and make a decision on what to do in cases when certain models are not appropriate for a given dataset.
