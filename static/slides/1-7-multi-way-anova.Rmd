## Multi-way ANOVA and interactions

ANOVA can be easily extended to accommodate any number of categorical variables. 

Variables may each contribute independently to a response, or they may work together to influence response values.

*Interaction effects* are important when the association between one independent variable and the response may depend on the level of another independent variable.

## Interaction example

For example, suppose that we are interested in a two-way ANOVA model in which the response $y$ is a measure of headache pain, and the independent variables include the type of pill taken $j$, with $j=1$ for placebo and $j=2$ for ibuprofen, and the number of pills taken $k$, where $k=1,2$.

While we may expect lower pain if multiple ibuprofen pills are taken, we would not expect the same decrease in pain if multiple placebo pills were taken. 


Consider the model
$$y_{ijk}=\mu + \alpha I(j=2) + \beta I(k=2) + \gamma I(j=k=2)+\varepsilon_{ijk}.$$



---
## Interaction example

$$y_{ijk}=\mu + \alpha I(j=2) + \beta I(k=2) + \gamma I(j=k=2)+\varepsilon_{ijk}$$

In this model, the mean is parameterized as follows.

| Drug | \# of Pills | Mean |
| ---- | :-----------: | :----: |
| Placebo | 1 | $\mu$ |
| Ibuprofen | 1 | $\mu+\alpha$ |
| Placebo | 2 | $\mu+\beta$ |
| Ibuprofen | 2 | $\mu +\alpha+\beta+\gamma$ |


What types of parameter values would we expect to see if there is an interaction in which there is a dose effect for Ibuprofen but not for placebo?




---
## Interaction example

$$y_{ijk}=\mu + \alpha I(j=2) + \beta I(k=2) + \gamma I(j=k=2)+\varepsilon_{ijk}$$

In this model,

  - the expected difference in pain level moving from 1 to 2 ibuprofen pills is $\mu+\alpha - \mu - \alpha - \beta - \gamma$
  - the expected difference in pain level moving from 1 to 2 placebo pills is $\mu - \mu - \beta$
  - the expected drug effect for those taking one pill is $\mu+\alpha-\mu=\alpha$
  - the expected drug effect for those taking two pills is $\mu+\alpha+\beta+\gamma - \mu - \beta=\alpha+\gamma$
  
  
So no interaction $(\gamma=0)$ means that the drug effect is the same regardless of the number of pills taken.

For there to be no drug effect at all, we need $\gamma=0$ and $\alpha=0$.

## R's most exciting data

We are going to explore R's most thrilling data -- the famous tooth growth in Guinea pigs data!


```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="350px",out.width="550px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/olivertwist.jpg")
```


Ahh, how cute!  Our Dickensian guinea pig has a mystery to solve -- which type of Vitamin C supplement is best for tooth growth!

## R's most exciting data

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="200px",out.width="200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/teeth1.jpg")
```


Guinea pig dental problems are NOT fun. 

Our dataset (Crampton, 1947) contains, as a response, the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs, each of which receives one dose of vitamin C (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/day) via one of two delivery methods (orange juice (OJ) or ascorbic acid (VC)).

Researchers wanted to know if the odontoblast length could be used as a marker of Vitamin C uptake, for the purposes of providing better nutritional supplementation to members of the Canadian armed forces (alas, the first of many injustices for Oliver Twisted Teeth -- the study was not done to help little Guinea piggies).

## R's most exciting data


```{r guineadescriptives0,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
gp=ToothGrowth
gp$dose=as.factor(gp$dose)
# Default bar plot
p<- ggplot(gp, aes(x=dose, y=len, fill=supp)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) 
# Finished bar plot
p+labs(title="Odontoblast length by dose", x="Dose (mg)", y = "Length")+
   theme_classic() +
   scale_fill_manual(values=c('#999999','#E69F00'))

```

## R's most exciting data

```{r guineadescriptives,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3.6}
library(ggplot2)
gp=ToothGrowth
gp$dose=as.factor(gp$dose)
# Default bar plot
p<- ggplot(gp, aes(x=dose, y=len, fill=supp)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) 
# Finished bar plot
p+labs(title="Odontoblast length by dose", x="Dose (mg)", y = "Length")+
   theme_classic() +
   scale_fill_manual(values=c('#999999','#E69F00'))

```

Looking at the boxplot of the growth data, what type of ANOVA model may be most appropriate?

We will revisit this in the class discussion sesssion.

<!-- ## Your task! -->

<!-- 1. Under your ANOVA model, write out (in terms of parameters) the means for each combination of supplement type and dose. -->
<!-- 2. Fit your model and provide a $\leq$ one-page summary of the analysis in language accessible to the general public. -->
<!-- 3. Suppose that greater lengths are indicative of better absorption. Make a recommendation for the dose(s) and supplement type(s) to be used to deliver vitamin C to armed forces members, assuming that the goal is to maximize absorption of vitamin C. Use statistical evidence to support your recommendation. -->
<!-- 4. Conduct diagnostic checks to see how well the assumptions behind your model are satisfied. Are there any reasons for concern about your model choice? -->
